        For our first week at NSS, the first cohort of UX Design, started with a challenge. In two minutes or less, present a character from childhood you had once loved. We had some cute choices from our cohort: Winnie the Pooh was one, Peter Parker another, Charlie Brown; we (the aptly named Agile Snails) chose Angelica Pickles from the Nickelodeon show, the Rugrats. 

	    With Angelica, of course, we had a clear memory of her prior conduct on the show. As a rather manipulative four year old, she loved to play with her four other companions in a day care run by her otherwise unemployed Uncle, and perpetually tired Grandfather. When not aware of her machinations, she’d torment her playmates. From this character we devised the following persona:

        Personality/Demographics:
    
        Upper middle class
        3-4 yrs old
        Showmanship, braggart, likes deranged looking dolls, hates diaper wearing babies
        Penchant for cruelty and manipulation

        Key Behaviors:

        - Loves dollar and doll houses
        - Sadistic, perhaps sociopathic
        - loves attention
        - Family centered, spoiled

        Needs / Functions:

        - likes to look pretty
        - likes to bully
        - intense compulsion to exact vengeance

        Goals:

        - tormenting Tommy Pickles and Chucky
        - causing trouble for others


        A notably dark persona to design for, but this was a first for us and we went wild. In addition to making a website out of nowhere, we also had to devise products. Some gems included “baby-tracker” (guess what that one does) or “DADDY!”, a parent notification site the emails, Facebook messages,  or Tweets at Angelica’s father to pay attention to his spoiled daughter. From this we decided the company had to be as equally menacing, but professional.
