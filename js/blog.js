		content : `For our first week at NSS, the first cohort of UX Design, started with a challenge. The day before, Susan told us to think of a favorite childhood character from TV. In two minutes or less, present a character from childhood you had once loved. We had some cute choices from our cohort: Winnie the Pooh was one, Peter Parker another, Charlie Brown; we (the aptly named Agile Snails) chose Angelica Pickles from the Nickelodeon show, the Rugrats. It was a first introduction for me as a contributor to a project that, all in all, wasn’t my idea and wasn’t something I was particularly interested in, but because of the requirements of the project I had to learn how to be productive about the subject, and be helpful to a team with many different set of skills. Here, we were devising actual products with out of the blue for a hypothetical company. Concerning myself with page layout, the thinking about information structure and it being delineated in a clear, logical way. Worrying about the design of a page, something that seemed (honestly) beyond me, but applying solid principles expounded on by our instructor Susan Culkin.

		Did we do any research on this market? Not for the first project. Coming up with a persona was the challenge, and building a solid website off of what we imagined the customer would or could want, since the persona was fictitious was the chief goal of the project.

			With Angelica, of course, we had a clear memory of her prior conduct on the show. As a rather manipulative four year old, she loved to play with her four other companions in a day care run by her otherwise unemployed Uncle, and perpetually tired Grandfather. When not aware of her machinations, she’d torment her playmates. From this character we devised the following persona:
		
		<img src=“20180410_141247.jpg”>
		
		
		USER PERSONA:
		
		
		Personality/Demographics:
		   
		Upper middle class
		3-4 yrs old
		Showmanship, braggart, likes deranged looking dolls, hates diaper-wearing babies
		Penchant for cruelty and manipulation
		
		Key Behaviors:
		
		 • Loves dollar and doll houses
		 • Sadistic, perhaps sociopathic
		 • loves attention
		 • Family centered, spoiled
		
		Needs / Functions:
		
		 • likes to look pretty
		 • likes to bully
		 • intense compulsion to exact vengeance
		
		Goals:
		
		 • tormenting Tommy Pickles and Chucky
		 • causing trouble for others
		
		
		A notably dark persona to design for, but this was a first for us and we went wild. In addition to making a website out of nowhere, we also had to devise products. Some gems included “baby-tracker” (guess what that one does) or “DADDY!”, a parent notification site the emails, Facebook messages,  or Tweets at Angelica’s father to pay attention to his spoiled daughter. From this we decided the company had to be as equally menacing, but professional.
		
		### Picture of Corporate HQ in Rugrats and Angelica’s Mom ###
		
		“MegaCorp”
		
		
		From there, we jumped to theme ideas. What was our top of the mountain? For our company, Mega Corp, to offer surveillance tools for the diabolical child, like Angelical.  To do that, our website would display the company. We decided to go extra corporate as inspired by Angelica’s mom (HER NAME). We went for ultra dark, based on the graphics from the Rugrats.

		content :`One of the more interesting things I’ve realized is working collaboratively can be such a miracle when it’s seamless. Something I’ve always complained about, and which I think is rapidly changing elsewhere, is the use of technologies in computer science programs to enhance studies and work together with classmates. It’s a rabbit hole, I’m sure. But the introduction of version control and Github in this program, and the absolute dependence on it and understanding of best practices, has made software engineering concepts like Agile and Scrum suddenly much more foundational and important methods.
		
		TOPICS: 
		
		This week, Susan went over Usability Heuristics for UI Design, which is a set of principals for the studied creative, and an all-around miracle checklist (for the uninitiated). The points are concepts that can be mitigated and not all points need to be adopted, but overall the concept is to apply as much of it to what we do as often as we can.

		Additionally, a future feature of class, she detailed, is the PRESENTATION — the moment you present your product (SPECIAL NAME?) to the clients. Every bit of the product has to be well-reasoned and based on set facts before the commission of the work.  That could be literally anything they gave you: style guides, target consumers (who there user is), previous work, project expectations…. 
		
		What would our User persona want the site to do?
		
		In addition to the Usability Heuristics, a forefront question for any responsible developer encompasses what does the User want from this product? Hopefully, whatever the business is, somehow the User’s role in all of this is clearly defined and applicable to the purpose of the product. The User Persona gives us User Experience people ideas to contextualize exactly who the generic User is, and what they are looking for in an online service. 
		
		“A persona is often defined as a representation of a user that embodies the characteristics, feelings and preferences of a user set. Personas deal with softer characteristics. They are typically depicted with a photo or image surrounded by descriptive characteristics and supporting attributes.” Product Roadmaps Relaunched
