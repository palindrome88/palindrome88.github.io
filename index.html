        <p> 
            I began my journey in 2014 at the College of Engineering at Tennessee State University for my degree in Computer Science, graduated in the fall of 2017. The field of tech
            is so vast, I never realized the viability of a career in User Experience however until I met recruiters from Microsoft looking for people with those skills. From there, my interest became
            my career pursuit.</p>

            <p>User Experience and Design appeals to me because of the synergy between art and tech. 
            Currently, I attend Nashville Software School in the UX/UI Developer Bootcamp (really love it), work for the Tennessee Air National Guard as an Imagery Analyst and have served in multiple military services since 2008. I
            My five year plan is to be an established User Experience professional in the Greater Nashville tech community.
