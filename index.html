    <h1>About me</h1>
    <a>
        <p> 
            I began my journey in 2014 at the College of Engineering at Tennessee State University. 
            I graduate with my degree in Computer Science in the fall of 2017.
            User Experience and Design appeals to me because of the synergy between art and tech. 
            Currently, I work for the Tennessee Air Guard as an Imagery Analyst and have served in multiple military services since 2008.
            My five year plan is to be an established User Experience professional in the Greater Nashville tech community.
